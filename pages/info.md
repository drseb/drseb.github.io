I am big fan of information visualisation. I love elegant web-applications. At the moment I am working a lot with [vaadin][1]. 

I have done some work using protein network analysis, namely I developed the [GeneWanderer][2] for identifying disease-relevant genes using a random-walk approach. 
I also use machine learing methods such as SVMs etc.

During my PhD I helped developing the [Human Phenotype Ontology][3]. I have published several tools and methods to harness the content of HPO 
for several purposes. This lead me to the semantic web world.

I program in Java most of the time, but I speak multiple languages.

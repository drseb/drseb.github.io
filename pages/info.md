I am big fan of information visualisation. I love elegant web-applications. At the moment I am working a lot with [vaadin][1]. I have previously worked with [Gephi][4] and Cytoscape for network visualisations.

I use use protein network analysis for genomics, namely I developed the [GeneWanderer][2] for identifying disease-relevant genes using a random-walk approach. 
I am also working with a lot machine learning methods such as SVMs, Deep Neural Networks, Ensemble methods and more.

During my PhD I helped developing the [Human Phenotype Ontology][3]. I have published several tools and methods to harness the content of HPO 
for several purposes in the genomics field. This lead me to the semantic web world.

I program in Java, R, Perl, Phython, JS, Matlab, bash, etc.

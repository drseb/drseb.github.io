Complex network analysis is an important field in the life science domain. Especially protein-protein interaction 
networks are an important tool for present-day biology and bioinformatics. Protein-protein interactions are the key determinants 
for cellular protein complexes, pathways, and others. Proteins do seldomly perform their function in isolation.
Mining protein interaction networks - often containing more than 15.000 nodes - requires computational methods, often developed in the context of complex network analysis.

Determining the similarity between two proteins based on their relative location in the protein interaction network is often hampered by the
discrete nature of networks. Two proteins can have a shortest-path distance of one, two, three, four... but seldomly more than five. Thus we
have employed a random-walk based method for calculating the similarity between proteins. The method we employed is also able to calculate the similarity between multiple start-nodes and other nodes. We have applied this method to the problem of disease gene identification and had a remarkable success.

Be sure you don't have any other libraries in your build path that may use a different version of OWLAPI. For me it was the wrong ELK version
in my build path, which leads to very mysterious errors such as:
<pre>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 
  org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.PrefixManager.setPrefix(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V
</pre>

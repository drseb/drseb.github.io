From 8th of March to 11th of March 2016 I joined the Kick-Off meeting of the HIPBI-RD project that we got funded. This is IMHO an extremly important project that we are working on with Orphanet (Ana Rath), PhenoTips (Mike Brudno), the EBI (Helen Parkinson) and the Garvan Institute (Tudor Groza). We met in Barcelona with all the people that will be working on the [HIPBI-RD project][1] in the following years. Really looking forward to that!

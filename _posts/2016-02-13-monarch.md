From 6th of Feb to 13th of Feb 2016 we had an important meeting with all the people from the [monarch-initiative][1]. The meeting took place in Portland, Oregon. I have to say that I was positively surprised by the atmosphere of the city. The nature around Portland seems to be worth another trip: I'm really jealous that they have the pacific ocean (1.5 hours to Cannon Beach) and fantastic mountains for skiing (1.5 hours to Mt. Hood) in close proximity.
